# SMoRG's QoL

A small collection of **opt-in** quality-of-life tweaks for World of Warcraft (Retail).

Everything is toggleable:
- ⚙️ via the in-game Settings UI, or
- 💬 via `/sqol` chat commands.

## What's new in 1.0.22

- 👥 **Party member levels** — shows each party member's level on both the default party frames and raid-style party frames. Enabled by default; toggle with `/sqol partylevel` (`pl`).

### 1.0.21

- ⏳ **LFG queue pop countdown** — a live timer showing how long you have left to accept when the group finder pops (40 seconds), turning red for the last 5. Toggle with `/sqol lfgtimer` (`lfg`).
- Fixed the ready check countdown being invisible when *you* started the ready check — Blizzard never shows the popup to the initiator, so the timer now moves to the top of the screen instead.

### 1.0.20

- ⏱️ **Ready check countdown** — a live timer showing how many seconds are left before the ready check expires, turning red for the last 5 seconds. Toggle with `/sqol readycheck` (`rc`).

### 1.0.19

- Colorized progress messages now cover scenario weighted-progress bars (e.g. Void Incursion's "Defending Stillwhisper"), which live outside the quest system and were previously never reported.

### 1.0.18

- RepWatch no longer rescans while the Reputation panel is open, so collapsing or expanding an expansion header no longer makes the list jump.

### 1.0.17

- Colorized progress messages now cover progress-bar quest objectives (e.g. "Umbral Attuning Shard charged"), using the objective's own label and without a duplicated percentage.

## Features

- 🧭 **Auto-track newly accepted quests**
  - Automatically tracks new quests in the Objective Tracker (with sanity checks to avoid unsupported edge cases).
- 🔔 **Quest completion alert**
  - Plays a sound (toggleable) and prints a chat message when a quest is ready to turn in (or done for bonus/world quests).
  - Optionally plays a separate worker voice line when an individual objective is completed before the full quest is done.
  - Supports selectable Horde (Peon) and Alliance (Human worker) sound profiles.
- 🎨 **Colorized progress messages**
  - Colorizes common progress patterns like `3/10` or `45%` and quest objective progress (red → yellow → green).
  - Also covers progress-bar quest objectives and scenario weighted-progress bars, which the default UI reports silently.
- ⏱️ **Ready check countdown**
  - Shows a live countdown of the seconds left on a ready check, turning red for the last 5 seconds.
  - Appears below the ready check popup, or near the top of the screen when you started the ready check yourself (Blizzard never shows the popup to the initiator).
- ⏳ **LFG queue pop countdown**
  - Shows how many of your 40 seconds are left to accept a group finder pop, turning red for the last 5.
  - Sits below the queue pop's ready status frame, so it stays useful while you wait for the rest of the group to accept.
- 👥 **Party member levels**
  - Shows each party member's level on both default and raid-style party frames while leaving raid and arena frames unchanged.
- 🚪 **Login splash**
  - Optional status splash on login showing which features are ON/OFF.
- ✅ **Hide completed achievements**
  - Makes the Achievement UI default to showing incomplete achievements only.
- 🤝 **Auto-watch reputation gains**
  - Switches your watched faction to the one that changed when you gain reputation.
- 🏷️ **Nameplate objective counts**
  - Shows quest objective progress (e.g., 0/10 or 45%) above relevant nameplates, with fallbacks for bonus/world quests.
- 🧾 **PlayerFrame iLvl + Speed**
  - Adds an extra line to the PlayerFrame: `iLvl: xx.x  Spd: yy%`
- 🖋️ **Custom damage text font**
  - Replaces floating combat text damage numbers with a custom font.
- 🖱️ **Cursor shake highlight**
  - Highlights the cursor when you shake the mouse.
- 🧪 **Debug tracking (optional)**
  - Enables verbose tracking output for troubleshooting.
